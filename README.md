# Musissify
Harmonic Intelligence for Musical Instrument Classiﬁcation
## Project Overview

This project involves training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify musical instruments from audio files. The project is divided into two main steps:<br> Training a CNN with ground truth labels <br> Analyzing the performance of both models.

### Steps
  Training the CNN with Ground Truth Labels<br>
        Objective: Train a CNN to classify instruments from audio files using the correct ground truth labels.<br>
        Model: Small CNN with chosen hyperparameters<br>
        Training: 30 epochs<br>
        Outcome: Save the trained model<br>


  Performance Analysis<br>
        Objective: Compare the performance of the CNN trained with ground truth labels and the CNN trained with pseudo labels.<br>
        Metrics: Accuracy and loss<br>
        Visualization: Plot graphs to contrast the CNN’s performance using ground truth labels and pseudo labels.<br>

## Dataset
The Data set used for the this task  can be accessed from here https://zenodo.org/records/3685367<br>
The data set consists of 2913 samples, each containing a single musical note from one of 14 different instruments:
    1)Bass Tuba <br>
    2)French Horn<br>
    3)Trombone<br>
    4)Trumpet in C<br>
    5)Accordion<br>
    6)Contrabass<br>
    7)Violin<br>
    8)Viola<br>
    9)Violoncello<br>
    10)Bassoon<br>
    11)Clarinet in B-flat<br>
    12)Flute<br>
    13)Oboe<br>
    14)Alto Saxophone<br>
Data set consists  2913 audio clips as WAV files, sampled at 44.1 kHz, with a single channel (mono), at a bit depth of 16. This is equivalent to the audio quality of a compact disc. Audio clips vary in duration between two and ten seconds.
